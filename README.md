# Internet traffic optimization using Reinforcement Learning.

The following project is a proof of concept to examine the feasibility and usability of designing a Reinforcement Learning based network controller capable of making internet traffic and routing decisions.

This repository is best described by the following [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DApO34I_Y0&t=10s) delivered at the Data Science Retreat in Berlin.

## Description

Since its early days the internet has quickly become a main part of our daily lives. And while the volume of traffic keeps increasing exponentially, the content shared has also changed considerably, from simple text and images to High definition streaming, IoTs and cloud computing.

As this trend keeps going simply increasing capacity may no longer be enough. To keep up with the demand it is interesting to consider a solution using by reingeering the networks into smart networks using A.I techniques such as reinforcement Learning.
